# MyToken - A Feature-Rich ERC20 Token

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a fully fledged and operational ERC20 token with advanced functionalities, including governance, staking, and a deflationary mechanism. It leverages OpenZeppelin contracts to provide a secure and robust foundation for token creation and management.

This contract goes beyond the basic ERC20 functionalities and incorporates features often found in modern decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from simple utility tokens to complex governance tokens with integrated staking and deflationary mechanisms.

## Features

### Core ERC20 Functionality

*   **Standard Compliance:** Fully implements all standard ERC20 functions as defined in the ERC20 token standard, including:
    *   `name()`: Returns the name of the token (e.g., "MyToken").
    *   `symbol()`: Returns the symbol of the token (e.g., "MTK").
    *   `decimals()`: Returns the number of decimals the token uses (e.g., 18).
    *   `totalSupply()`: Returns the total token supply.
    *   `balanceOf(address account)`: Returns the token balance of a specific account.
    *   `transfer(address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers tokens from the caller's account to another account.
    *   `allowance(address owner, address spender)`: Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through `transferFrom()`.
    *   `approve(address spender, uint256 amount)`: Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller's tokens.
    *   `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`: Transfers `amount` tokens from `from` to `to` using the allowance mechanism.

### Minting and Burning

*   **Minting:**  New tokens can be minted and added to the total supply by addresses with the `MINTER_ROLE`. This is useful for initial token distribution, rewarding users, or implementing specific tokenomics models.
*   **Burning:**  Tokens can be burned and removed from the total supply using the `burn()` function. This is typically used to implement deflationary mechanisms or to permanently remove tokens from circulation. Only accounts with the `BURNER_ROLE` can burn tokens.

### Snapshots

*   **Balance Snapshots:** The contract supports creating snapshots of token balances at specific points in time. This is useful for various purposes, such as:
    *   Record balances before and after airdrops or other events.
    *   Implement governance mechanisms that require historical balance information.
    *   Track token ownership for reward distribution or other calculations.

### Access Control

*   **Role-Based Permissions:** Uses OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` contract to manage roles and permissions for different actions within the contract. This ensures that only authorized addresses can perform sensitive operations like minting, burning, pausing, and taking snapshots.
*   **Predefined Roles:** The contract includes the following predefined roles:
    *   `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: The administrator role that can assign other roles and manage the contract's configuration.
    *   `SNAPSHOT_ROLE`:  Can take snapshots of token balances.
    *   `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause and unpause token transfers.
    *   `MINTER_ROLE`: Can mint new tokens.
    *   `BURNER_ROLE`: Can burn tokens.

### Pausable Transfers

*   **Emergency Stop:** The contract allows pausing and unpausing token transfers. This can be used as an emergency measure to halt token activity in case of security vulnerabilities, unexpected behavior, or other critical situations.

### Governance

*   **On-Chain Governance:**  Implements a basic on-chain governance mechanism that allows token holders to create and vote on proposals. This enables decentralized decision-making and community involvement in the project's direction.
    *   `createProposal(string memory description)`:  Allows token holders to create proposals with a text description.
    *   `castVote(uint256 proposalId, bool vote)`:  Enables token holders to vote on proposals (yes/no).
    *   `executeProposal(uint256 proposalId)`:  Executes a proposal if it passes the voting and quorum requirements. The specific logic for executing proposals needs to be implemented based on the project's needs.

### Staking

*   **Token Staking:** Allows users to stake their tokens to earn rewards. This incentivizes long-term holding and participation in the network.
    *   `stake(uint256 amount)`:  Allows users to stake a specified amount of tokens.
    *   `unstake(uint256 amount)`:  Allows users to unstake a specified amount of tokens.
    *   `claimRewards()`:  Allows users to claim their accumulated staking rewards.

### Deflationary Mechanism

*   **Automatic Token Burning:**  Implements a deflationary mechanism that automatically burns a small percentage of tokens on every transfer. This can help control token supply and potentially increase token value over time.

### Events

*   **Event Logging:**  Emits events for all significant actions within the contract, including:
    *   `Transfer`:  Emitted on token transfers.
    *   `Approval`:  Emitted on approval operations.
    *   `Snapshot`:  Emitted when a snapshot is taken.
    *   `Paused`:  Emitted when the contract is paused.
    *   `Unpaused`:  Emitted when the contract is unpaused.
    *   `ProposalCreated`:  Emitted when a new proposal is created.
    *   `VoteCast`:  Emitted when a vote is cast on a proposal.
    *   `ProposalExecuted`:  Emitted when a proposal is executed.
    *   `StakingReward`:  Emitted when staking rewards are claimed.
    *   `TokensBurned`:  Emitted when tokens are burned.

These events provide transparency and allow off-chain applications to track and respond to the contract's activity.


## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Solidity compiler (version 0.8.9 or higher)
    *   Ethereum development environment (or environment for the desired blockchain)
    *   [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) library

2.  **Installation:**
    *   Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyToken.git`
    *   Install OpenZeppelin Contracts: `npm install @openzeppelin/contracts`

3.  **Deployment:**
    *   Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
    *   Deploy the contract to the desired blockchain network using a tool like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

4.  **Usage:**
    *   Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using web3 libraries or other blockchain-specific tools.
    *   Use the functions provided to mint new tokens, burn tokens, take snapshots, pause/unpause transfers, manage access control roles, create and vote on proposals, and stake tokens.


## Customization

*   **Token Name and Symbol:** Change the token name and symbol in the constructor (`ERC20("MyToken", "MTK")`).
*   **Initial Supply:** Set the initial token supply in the constructor or mint tokens later using the `mint()` function.
*   **Access Control:**  Modify the roles and permissions in the `AccessControl` contract to define who can perform specific actions (minting, burning, pausing, snapshots).
*   **Governance Parameters:** Adjust `proposalThreshold`, `votingPeriod`, and `quorumPercentage` to define the governance rules.
*   **Staking Parameters:** Modify `stakingRewardRate` to adjust the staking rewards.
*   **Deflationary Mechanism:** Change the `burnRate` to control the token burn percentage on transfers.
*   **Additional Functionality:**  Add more features to the contract as needed, such as:
    *   Tokenomics with specific rules or mechanisms.
    *   Advanced governance features (e.g., delegated voting, quadratic voting).
    *   Integration with other DeFi protocols or services.

## Security Considerations

*   **Security Audit:** It's highly recommended to have a professional security audit conducted on the contract code before deploying it to a live network.
*   **Access Control:** Carefully manage the roles and permissions to prevent unauthorized access and actions.
*   **Pausing:** Use the pausing functionality responsibly to address potential issues or emergencies.
*   **Snapshots:** Understand the implications of taking snapshots and how they might affect token balances and operations.
*   **Governance:** Ensure that the governance mechanism is secure and resistant to manipulation or attacks.
*   **Staking:**  Consider potential risks associated with staking, such as slashing or lock-up periods.
